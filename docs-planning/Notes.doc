1. figure out all the routes
  - gets: page viewing
  - posts: happens when entering into the database
    - usually happens in a form

redirect: can pass in the route THEN need a get path for the redirect
-can pass in the quizid, userid

home is /

create browser should just be /create
Clicking create button should POST to /create
once created, we want to redirect to homepage or myquizzes
db.query ... Use an INSERT (return ID of inserted database), in the .then...

Myquizzes route should be /users/:userid/quizzes
START (button) should be a GET /users/:userid/quizzes/:quizid
SUBMIT (button) should be a POST /users/:userid/quizzes/:quizid
db.query ...   we can do a redirect to /users/:userid/quizzes/:quizid/results
